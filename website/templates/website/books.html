          <div class="title">The Underactive Thyroid - Blurb</div>
          <div class="text">"Are you tired all the time no matter how much you rest? Have you been gradually putting on weight despite efforts to 'diet'? Do you always feel cold? Is your hair thinning and/or your eyebrows disappearing? Do you catch every bug going around? Do even small injuries take an age to heal? Have you had tests for an underactive thyroid and been told all is well? Hypothyroidism is the obvious cause of these symptoms and now one of the commonest chronic conditions yet it is also one of the worst treated in Western medicine. Why? Because today's doctor is trained only to treat blood tests, not patients, even though patients may have all the classic signs and symptoms. In The Underactive Thyroid Dr Sarah Myhill and Craig Robinson shows us what those signs and symptoms are, all stemming from the metabolism running slow, and what the problems with diagnostic blood tests are that mean they cannot be relied on in isolation. Advocating lifestyle measures, iodine, and natural thyroid glandulars (TGs) where found to be necessary, the authors also show us the consequences of untreated hypothyroidism at every stage of life and why it is so important to take remedying the problem safely into your own hands if your doctor can't give you the support you need."

          <div class="text">
            Big Pharma-driven Western medicine, based on symptom-suppressing prescription drugs, is failing to prevent and treat our modern epidemics of diabetes, dementia, degeneration, cancer, heart disease and infections. Ecological Medicine gives us the 'Rules of the Game' and the 'Tools of the Trade' to prevent and treat these pathologies. It achieves this through a logical, evidence-based approach.
            <br>
            <br>
            Launched in 2020, it is a distillation of over four decades of Dr Sarah Myhill's experience as a doctor, starting out in the NHS and moving into private practice to escape the straitjacket of official clinical guidelines. Writing with Craig Robinson, she clearly outlines the roadmap to recovery and illustrates this from the perspective of all medical diseases, from cancer and cardiology to neurology and nephrology. These medical 'ologies are further illustrated by real case histories that have shaped, and continue to shape, her medical practice.

            <br>
            Three years on there has been too much to add and update in a simple reprint, necessitating this larger second edition. With completely revised chapters on iodine, vitamin C, the paleo-ketogenic diet, and eye problems, plus new detail throughout drawn from experience during the Covid-19 pandemic, this represents the most comprehensive and up-to-date account of Dr Myhill's approach to empowering us all to take charge of our own health.

          <div class="title">Paleo-Ketogenic: The Why and the How - Blurb</div>
          <div class="text">Through more than 30 years of medical practice, focusing increasingly on health problems for which conventional medicine has few answers, especially chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalitis, and its causes, Dr Sarah Myhill has reached the conclusion that diet is the single most important aspect that each of us needs to address to restore and maintain good health. Her clinical work and her study of evolutionary nutrition have brought her to the firm conclusion that the combination of 'Paleo' (no processed foods, no dairy, no gluten grains) and 'Ketogenic' (low-carb, high-fat and high-fibre but NOT high-protein) is essential for combating the root causes of most modern illnesses: infections, allergies, addictions and the upper fermenting gut.
            <br>
            <br>
            Changing one's diet is always difficult and, as ever, the devil is in the detail. Paleo-Ketogenic: The Why and the How supplies the intricate detail that takes the devil out and makes the move to a PK diet as frictionless as possible. This is achieved by supplying the intellectual imperative (the Why) and the practical reality to achieve such (the How).
            <br>
            <br>
            With over 60 PK recipes plus weekly meal plans, shopping lists and short cuts, the book will get you started on this way of eating. It also gives you the principles on which to develop your own recipes and personal preferences, sustainably for a lifetime.

                   <div class="text">What determines the survival of the fittest is energy. Those animals with the most energy will be better feeders, movers and procreators. They will pass their energetic genes and survival strategies down to the next generation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From hairy great apes, evolution has produced the super-successful, super-fit, clever calculating machines of us - the naked little apes. Modern homo sapiens should be fitter, stronger and cleverer than all previous versions. But we naked apes have become knackered apes. Physical, mental and emotional fatigues abound and these are the fore-runners of obesity, diabetes, dementia, cancer and coronaries. Why?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Energy Equation explains. It describes how to maximise energy delivery mechanisms in the body and then how to spend this energy efficiently by reducing immunological and emotional holes in your personal energy bucket and minimise energy-draining biochemical and mechanical frictions. Reducing and minimising these holes and frictions not only improves your own energy equation now, but also addresses the downstream effects of these holes and frictions - namely, the serious pathologies of the Western World.
                    This leaves us with an abundance of energy to spend on life, creating a safe ecological niche for our families, having fun, being creative and avoiding the dread diseases of our age.
                    Thus we can live to our full potential.

Wrong - research now shows that our big killers, from cancers and coronaries to dementia and diabetes are largely infection-driven. Indeed, it is difficult to find a pathology that does not have an infectious associate. Cheap and effective defences are within the grasp of all of us. We have all the weapons we need to win the arms race.

Her book, "Prevent and Cure Diabetes", (see [1]) saw her arrive at the conclusion that the diet we should all be eating is one that combines Paleo principles (eating pre-agricultural, seasonal foods) with ketogenic ones (fuel the body with fats and fibre, not with carbs or protein). That book tells us WHY; now, in this down-to-earth, highly practical cookbook, Sarah tell us HOW.

Already in 2010, more than one million people in the UK were thought to have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, double the previous estimate, and as long ago as 2008 between 20% and 30% of the adult population could be characterised as having the 'metabolic syndrome' - the forerunner to diabetes.
                                    The tragedy is that most people with these conditions regard them as inevitable evils and agree to take the medicine - or inject the insulin - when the time comes. BUT it need not be that way.

                                    All medical therapies should start with diet. Modern Western diets are driving our modern epidemics of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia; this process is called metabolic syndrome. In this book I explain in detail why and how we have arrived at a situation where the real weapons of mass destruction can be found in our kitchens. Importantly, the book describes the vital steps every one of us can make to reverse the situation so that life can be lived to its full potential.

                                       <div class="text">Through more than 30 years of medical practice, focusing increasingly on health problems for which conventional medicine has few answers, especially chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalitis, and its causes, Dr Sarah Myhill has reached the conclusion that diet is the single most important aspect that each of us needs to address to restore and maintain good health. Her clinical work and her study of evolutionary nutrition have brought her to the firm conclusion that the combination of 'Paleo' (no processed foods, no dairy, no gluten grains) and 'Ketogenic' (low-carb, high-fat and high-fibre but NOT high-protein) is essential for combating the root causes of most modern illnesses: infections, allergies, addictions and the upper fermenting gut.

                                         Changing one's diet is always difficult and, as ever, the devil is in the detail. Paleo-Ketogenic: The Why and the How supplies the intricate detail that takes the devil out and makes the move to a PK diet as frictionless as possible. This is achieved by supplying the intellectual imperative (the Why) and the practical reality to achieve such (the How).

                                         With over 60 PK recipes plus weekly meal plans, shopping lists and short cuts, the book will get you started on this way of eating. It also gives you the principles on which to develop your own recipes and personal preferences, sustainably for a lifetime.
