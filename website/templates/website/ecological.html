        <div class="info_container">
            'Written with mathematician Craig Robinson, Ecological Medicine is Sarah Myhill's magnum opus. As such it should be in every medical practice. It pulls no punches in looking at the degeneration of our health, overseen by doctors corrupted by Big Pharma. â€¦ If you buy only one book from this whole field, this should be it.' <b>David Lorimer, Paradigm Explorer: Journal of the Scientific and Medical Network 2020</b>
        </div>

        <p>Big Pharma-driven Western medicine, based on symptom-suppressing prescription drugs, is failing to prevent and treat our modern epidemics of diabetes, dementia, degeneration, cancer, heart disease and infections. Ecological Medicine gives us the 'Rules of the Game' and the 'Tools of the Trade' to prevent and treat these pathologies. It achieves this through a logical, evidence-based approach.</p>

        <p>Launched in 2020, it is a distillation of over four decades of Dr Sarah Myhill's experience as a doctor, starting out in the NHS and moving into private practice to escape the straitjacket of official clinical guidelines. Writing with Craig Robinson, she clearly outlines the roadmap to recovery and illustrates this from the perspective of all medical diseases, from cancer and cardiology to neurology and nephrology. These medical 'ologies are further illustrated by real case histories that have shaped, and continue to shape, her medical practice.</p>            

        <p>Three years on there has been too much to add and update in a simple reprint, necessitating this larger second edition. With completely revised chapters on iodine, vitamin C, the paleo-ketogenic diet, and eye problems, plus new detail throughout drawn from experience during the Covid-19 pandemic, this represents the most comprehensive and up-to-date account of Dr Myhill's approach to empowering us all to take charge of our own health.</p>
            
        <p>Doctors should be clinical detectives and so should we with regard to our own health. Symptoms and signs give us the clues to the mechanisms of diseases and so lead us to the WHY of our health problems. Knowing the WHY provides the intellectual imperatives to drive through the difficult HOWs of disease reversal and restoration to full health. We should all just do it!</p>

        <h6>Preface to 2nd Edition</h6>

        <div class="infor_container">
            Medical practice should never stand still. It is called practice for a good reason - we are constantly learning.  I have received so many new ideas and much interesting feedback from physicians and patients over the last two years that a second edition became essential. The principles remain the same: work out the mechanisms from the symptoms and signs and this leads to logical and effective treatment. These principles meant that we were able to effectively treat covid 19 patients from the very start of this new disease - we simply applied Groundhog Acute. In consequence, none of my patients died. I only know of one who needed a brief hospital admission before recovering. For details of the treatment of covid 19 see chapter 52 (New killers of the 21st century).

    <h2>Book Review of 'Ecological Medicine'</h2>
        
        <p>This review was written by David Lorimer and appeared on page 61 of PARADIGM EXPLORER - Journal of the Scientific and Medical Network (ISSN 1362-1211 | No 134 | 2020/3)</p>

        <p><b>"I have reviewed a number of Sarah Myhill's previous books, and this one is her magnum opus, subtitled 'the antidote to Big Pharma and fast foods.' As such, it should be in every medical practice. The book pulls no punches in looking at the degeneration of our health overseen by doctors corrupted by Big Pharma 'with kindness, gentleness and great humanity' in spite of being locked into a pharmaceutical straitjacket. Myhill has been a courageous advocate of natural approaches and learned to her cost that most doctors 'do not want to know about such safe, simple and effective medical interventions', but rather treated her as a troublemaker challenging their 'intellectually easy, drug based, simple algorithms for health management'. Only recently, a colleague sent me a petition where she was once again being hauled up before the General Medical Council, and in this book, we learn that has had to deal with 30 separate GMC investigations between 2000 and 2012, conducting her own legal defence, and being suspended in 2010 for lacking respect for the regulatory body! The GMC lawyers stated that 'the problem with the Myhill cases is that all the patients are improved and refuse to give witness statements'!"</b></p>
        
        <p><b>"The book is designed to 'empower people to heal themselves through addressing the root causes of their diseases', progressing from symptoms to underlying mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms allopathically and proceeding to sustainable treatments. Readers of her earlier books will be familiar with her emphasis on chronic inflammation and the usefulness of the paleo-ketogenic diet as well as her Groundhog Basic protocol. The book proceeds from symptoms and clinical pictures to mechanisms, then to the basics of natural health and bolt-on extras such as vitamin C, iodine and vitamin B12. It then applies these insights to the various branches of medicine and contains a detailed series of chapters with illustrative case histories. Interspersed in the text are many apposite quotations that add spice to the whole, such as Sherlock Holmes saying that 'the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes', or Sir William Osler - 'just listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis'; 'the good physician treats the disease, the great physician treats the patient who has the disease.' Towards the end, there are detailed worked examples of current case histories, which will be of extraordinary interest to practitioners."</b></p>
        
        <p><b>"If you only buy one book from this whole field, this should be it."</b></p>
    
    <h2>What is this book about?</h2>

        <p>This is my most extensive book - 496 pages in total, double columns on each page.</p>

        <p>This book gives readers the 'Rules of the Game' and the 'Tools of the Trade' to both prevent illness and, where it arises, treat all disease, especially those driven by modern Western lifestyles.</p>
        
        <p>The 'Rules' and 'Tools' will also enable the 'well' to achieve optimal wellness. The objective of this book is to empower readers to maximise both the quantity and quality of their lives.</p>
        
        <p>This is achieved through a logical path, an 'eco-logical' path, using an evidence-based approach, taking the reader from their symptoms, which are clues, through to the mechanisms of disease and finally to sustainable treatments.</p>
        
        <p>It is all about finding the WHY of disease in order to determine the HOWs to treat. Knowing the WHY gives the intellectual imperative to drive through with the sometimes difficult HOWs.</p>
        
        <p>These treatments are all sustainable in that they reverse disease processes, rather than escalate them, as modern Western prescription medicine does, and also in that they are easily accessible to all - diet, supplements and so on.</p>
        
        <p>This book is a distillation of four decades of my academic studies and clinical experience, working both in the British NHS, and as an Independent Medical Practitioner. The roadmap to recovery is clearly laid out, and this is illustrated from the perspective of a range of diseases, from cancer to cardiology, to neurology and nephrology. These 'ologies are further illustrated by real life Case Histories that have shaped my practice and continue to do so.</p>

    <h2>My Ecological Medicine Workshop</h2>

        <p>I now run Ecological Medicine Workshops where I go through the contents of this book and show how it can be applied to the individual circumstances of the workshop participants.</p>

        <p>Originally, these workshops were conducted in person at village halls, individual's houses and so on, but for the time being, and whilst social distancing rules still apply during the Corona Virus Pandemic, I am doing these via Zoom.</p>
